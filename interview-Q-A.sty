Asynchronous operations in Angular are operations that don't block the main execution thread. They allow you to perform tasks in the background while the application continues to run.
What is the difference between Promise and Observable?

A Promise is a one-time operation that resolves to a value or an error. An Observable is a stream of values that can change over time.
What is RxJS?

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables. It allows you to work with asynchronous data streams and provides operators for transforming, filtering, and combining those streams.
What is Observable? How to implement Observable

An Observable is a stream of values that can change over time. In Angular, Observables are often used to represent asynchronous data streams. To create an Observable, you can use the Observable.create() method or one of the creation functions provided by RxJS, such as of(), from(), or interval().

An Enum in TypeScript is a way to define a set of named constants. It allows you to assign names to numeric values, making your code more readable and maintainable.
What is Type Assertion in Typescript?

Type Assertion in TypeScript is a way to tell the compiler that you know more about the type of a variable than it does. It is used to override the default type inference behavior of the compiler.
What are Arrow Functions in Typescript?

Arrow Functions in TypeScript are a shorthand syntax for defining anonymous functions. They are used to create functions that are concise and easy to read.

What is Routing in Angular?

Routing in Angular is a mechanism that allows you to navigate between different components in a single-page application. It is used to define the mapping between URLs and components, and to handle navigation events.
What is Lazy Loading in Angular?
